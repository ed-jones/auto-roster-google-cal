# Auto Roster

I built this to save myself from tediously copying my emailed work roster into Google Calendar. 

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository
2. Run `yarn install`
3. Copy your week's roster into a file called `roster.txt` in the root directory
4. Run `yarn start`
5. Authenticate the app using the link found in the console
6. Voil√†
